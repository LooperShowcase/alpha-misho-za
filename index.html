      <h1>cars</h1>
      <p>
        The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car, when German
        inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. [3][4][5] Cars
        became widely available during the 20th century. One of the first cars
        affordable by the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car
        manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the
        US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts.[6] In Europe
        and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase
        until after World War II. [6] The car is considered an essential part of
        the developed economy.

      <h2>rocket</h2>
      <p>
        rocket (from Italian: rocchetto, lit. 'bobbin/spool')[nb 1][1] is a
        vehicle that uses jet propulsion to accelerate without using the
        surrounding air. A rocket engine produces thrust by reaction to exhaust
        expelled at high speed.[2] Rocket engines work entirely from propellant
        carried within the vehicle; therefore a rocket can fly in the vacuum of
        space. In fact rockets work more efficiently in a vacuum and incur a
        loss of thrust due to the opposing pressure of the atmosphere.
        Multistage rockets are capable of attaining escape velocity from Earth
        and therefore can achieve unlimited maximum altitude. Compared with
        airbreathing engines, rockets are lightweight and powerful and capable
        of generating large accelerations. To control their flight, rockets rely
        on momentum, airfoils, auxiliary reaction engines, gimballed thrust ,
        momentum wheels, deflection of the exhaust stream, propellant flow,
        spin, or gravity.
